        <h2>Dubai: Story and The History</h2>
        <p>The world has a very few urban miracles. And, Dubai is one of them. This city never ceases to amaze the
            world. A futuristic city. A city full of cutting-age technology and gleaming high-rise buildings. Only our
            forefathers could imagine this in a Sci-Fi story 100 years ago.

        <h2>Downtown Dubai</h2>
        <p>
            In the year 2006, about a quarter of the cranes in the world were occupied in building the massive
            structures we see in Dubai today. The history of Dubai tourism shows that more and more tourists started
            pouring into the city once these towering and glistening buildings were up and running. And once the Burj
            Khalifa joined the party, Dubai shot to fame as being the home of the tallest man-made structure in the
            world, bringing in a huge influx of travelers from all over the world to see this massive beauty.

        <h2>Dubai Creek</h2>
        <p>
            The creek divides the city into two parts: Bur Dubai and Deira, and has played a major role in the economic
            development of the region throughout history. The first recorded reference to Dubai dates back to 1587, when
            the Venetian pearl merchant Gaspero Balbi visited the area and wrote of Dubai's pearling industry.
